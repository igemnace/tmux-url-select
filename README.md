This is a personal fork! My changes are mostly configuration. If you're not me,
you're most likely looking for [dequis/tmux-url-select][upstream].

Place `tmux-url-select.pl` somewhere in your PATH, then bind a key to run it:

    bind-key some-key-here run tmux-url-select.pl

Or install with [TPM][tpm].
